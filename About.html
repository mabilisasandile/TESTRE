			<h1><i>Hi, welcome to my website... <br /></i></h1>
            <p align="center" style="padding-left: 20vh; padding-right: 20vh;">
                My name is Sandile Joseph Mabilisa, I studied Information Technology (Software Development) 
                at the Tshwane University of Technology. I started the course in foundation were 
                I did Microsoft (excel, word and PowerPoint), pseudo codes, algorithms and visual basic.
            </p>
            <p align="center" style="padding-left: 20vh; padding-right: 20vh;">
                During my academic studies I studied comptia A+, computing fundamentals, programming(c++),
                web development(html) and database (SQL). In my final year I managed to complete a system project
				while doing the major module (DSO34BT). It gave me a big challenge as it pushed me and introduced me 
				to other tools and development languages, namely: Java, Javascript, CSS, NodeJS, and MongoDB.
            </p>
			<p align="center" style="padding-left: 20vh; padding-right: 20vh;">
			While in school, I worked hard to hone my software installation and solution development skills. I 
			am focused and attentive to detail when addressing high-volume task loads to meet deadlines. I am 
			inspired by making a positive impact by applying application-building skills and my problem-solving 
			abilities allow me to address challenges to achieve results.
			</p>
			<p align="center" style="padding-left: 20vh; padding-right: 20vh;">
				My academic experiences have served me well in developing my communication, critical thinking, 
				and problem-solving skills. I work well to use clear and concise communication to interact 
				professionally with co-workers, supervisors and customers. I look forward to speaking with you 
				regarding my skill set and attributes which I believe will serve as an asset to support your 
				organisation's mission. Your time and consideration is much appreciated.
